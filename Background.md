#### object-fit:

The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container.

The object-fit property can have the following values:

- fill - This is default. The replaced content is sized to fill the element's content box. If necessary, the object will be stretched or squished to fit
- contain - The replaced content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the element's content box
- cover - The replaced content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. The object will be clipped to fit
- none - The replaced content is not resized
- scale-down - The content is sized as if none or contain were specified (would result in a smaller concrete object size)
